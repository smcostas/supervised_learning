# supervised_learning
This repository contains a practical assignment for the Supervised Learning course within the Data Science diploma program. The activity consisted of a Kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/supervisado-diplodatos2024/overview. The aim was to build machine learning models to predict diabetes in patients based on their clinical history and demographic information. 
I created all .py code files. The .ipynb file was a collaborative effort by all group members, but I specified which member contributed to each part of the activity.
